### Impact
Denial of Service

### Description
From IoControlCode 0x8018E008, there is global buffer overflow when calling memmove with the src address and size controllable, which leads to denial of service or other impacts.

### Reproduce
In the attached file DoS2.zip, there are DoS2.exe, DoS2.cpp, iobit_malware_fighter_setup.exe, and IMFCameraProtect.sys. DoS2.exe is the PoC to cause DoS where iobit_malware_fighter_setup.exe which contains the vulnerable driver IMFCameraProtect.sys is installed, and DoS2.cpp is the source code of DoS2.exe. To reproduce the issue, install iobit_malware_fighter_setup.exe and execute DoS2.exe. It is expected that the system will crash (BSOD) once DoS2.exe is executed. Password for attachment: DoS2
