## Easy File Locker, xlkfs.sys, DoS
### Vulnerability Info
* CVE-2023-0908
* [VulDB](https://vuldb.com/?id.221457)
* [MITRE CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-0908)

### Version
* Easy File Locker 2.2.0.184, xlkfs.sys 2.2.0.184
* https://xoslab.com/efl.html

### Impact
Denial of Service

### Description
In MessageNotifyCallback, a normal user can send a large value by FilterConnectCommunicationPort to cause out of bound due to the lack of validating input buffer, which will lead to DoS or possibly have unspecified other impact.

### Reproduce
In the attached file DoS.zip, there are DoS.exe, DoS.cpp, EFL2.2_Setup(x64).exe, and xlkfs.sys. DoS.exe is the PoC to cause BSOD where EFL2.2_Setup(x64).exe which contains the vulnerable driver xlkfs.sys is installed, and DoS.cpp is the source code of DoS.exe. To reproduce the issue, just install EFL2.2_Setup(x64).exe and execute DoS.exe. It is expected that the system will crash (BSOD) once DoS.exe is executed.
