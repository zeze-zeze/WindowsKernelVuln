## IObit Malware Fighter, ObCallbackProcess.sys, DoS

### Vulnerability Info
* CVE-2023-1642
* [VulDB](https://vuldb.com/?id.224022)
* [MITRE CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-1642)

### Version
* IObit Malware Fighter 9.4.0.776, ObCallbackProcess.sys 9.0.0.12
* https://www.iobit.com/en/malware-fighter.php

### Impact
Denial of Service

### Description
From IoControlCode 0x222034, 0x222038, 0x22203C, and 0x222040, there is no validation of pool boundary in the function, which may access uninitialized memory and cause BSOD.

### Reproduce
In the attached file DoS3.zip, there are DoS3.exe, DoS3.cpp, iobit_malware_fighter_setup.exe, and ObCallbackProcess.sys. DoS3.exe is the PoC to cause DoS where iobit_malware_fighter_setup.exe which contains the vulnerable driver ObCallbackProcess.sys is installed, and DoS3.cpp is the source code of DoS3.exe. To reproduce the issue, install iobit_malware_fighter_setup.exe and execute DoS3.exe. It is expected that the system will crash (BSOD) once DoS3.exe is executed. Password for attachment: DoS3
