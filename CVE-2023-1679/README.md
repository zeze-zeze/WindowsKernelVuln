## DriverGenius, mydrivers64.sys, Read/Write Arbitrary Physical Memory

### Vulnerability Info
* CVE-2023-1679
* [VulDB](https://vuldb.com/?id.224236)
* [MITRE CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-1679)

### Version
* DriverGenius 9.70.0.346, mydrivers64.sys 9.2.707.1214
* http://www.drivergenius.com/

### Impact
Read/Write Arbitrary Physical Memory

### Description
From IoControlCode 0x9C406104 and 0x9C40A108, a normal user can read and write physical memory arbitrarily, which can lead to escalation of privilege or kernel execution.

### Reproduce
In the attached file ReadWriteArbitraryPhysicalMemory.zip, there are ReadWriteArbitraryPhysicalMemory.exe, ReadWriteArbitraryPhysicalMemory.cpp, DGSetup_Home_BZNR.exe, and mydrivers64.sys. ReadWriteArbitraryPhysicalMemory.exe is the PoC to read and write physical memory where DGSetup_Home_BZNR.exe which contains the vulnerable driver mydrivers64.sys is installed, and ReadWriteArbitraryPhysicalMemory.cpp is the source code of ReadWriteArbitraryPhysicalMemory.exe. To reproduce the issue, install DGSetup_Home_BZNR.exe and execute ReadWriteArbitraryPhysicalMemory.exe. It is expected that the physical memory at address 0 will be read and written to 0xdeadbeef, then read again to show the new value.  Password for attachment: ReadWriteArbitraryPhysicalMemory
