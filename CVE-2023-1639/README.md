## IObit Malware Fighter, ImfRegistryFilter.sys, DoS

### Vulnerability Info
* CVE-2023-1639
* [VulDB](https://vuldb.com/?id.224019)
* [MITRE CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-1639)

### Version
* IObit Malware Fighter 9.4.0.776, ImfRegistryFilter.sys 8.0.0.0
* https://www.iobit.com/en/malware-fighter.php

### Impact
Denial of Service

### Description
From IoControlCode 0x8001E04C, the program looks for "\r\n" in the contents of user input. Thus a normal user can cause DoS if the input does not contain "\r\n" and it accesses uninitialized memory.

### Reproduce
In the attached file DoS2.zip, there are DoS2.exe, DoS2.cpp, iobit_malware_fighter_setup.exe, and ImfRegistryFilter.sys. DoS2.exe is the PoC to cause BSOD where iobit_malware_fighter_setup.exe which contains the vulnerable driver ImfRegistryFilter.sys is installed, and DoS2.cpp is the source code of DoS2.exe. To reproduce the issue, install iobit_malware_fighter_setup.exe and execute DoS2.exe. It is expected that the system will crash (BSOD) once DoS2.exe is executed. Password for attachment: DoS2
