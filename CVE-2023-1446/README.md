## Watchdog Anti-Virus, wsdk-driver.sys, DoS

### Vulnerability Info
* CVE-2023-1446
* [VulDB](https://vuldb.com/?id.223291)
* [MITRE CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-1446)

### Version
* Watchdog Anti-Virus 1.4.214.0, wsdk-driver.sys 0.3.1.0
* https://watchdog.dev/solutions/anti-virus/

### Impact
Denial of Service

### Description
From IoControlCode 0x80002004 and 0x80002008, a normal user can cause DoS due to the lack of null terminated before passing as SourceString to RtlInitUnicodeString.

### Reproduce
In the attached file DoS.zip, there are DoS.exe, DoS.cpp, WAV_Setup.exe, and wsdk-driver.sys. DoS.exe is the PoC to cause DoS where WAV_Setup.exe which contains the vulnerable driver wsdk-driver.sys is installed, and DoS.cpp is the source code of DoS.exe. To reproduce the issue, just install WAV_Setup.exe and execute DoS.exe. It is expected that the system will crash (BSOD) once DoS.exe is executed. Password for attachment: DoS
