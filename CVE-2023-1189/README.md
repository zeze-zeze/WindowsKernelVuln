### Vulnerability Info
* CVE-2023-1189
* [VulDB](https://vuldb.com/?id.222361)
* [MITRE CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-1189)

### Version
* Wise Folder Hider  4.4.3.202, WiseFs64.sys 2.0.3.222
* https://www.wisecleaner.com/wise-folder-hider.html

### Impact
Denial of Service

### Description
From IoControlCode 0x222400, 0x222404, and 0x222410, a normal user can cause DoS due to the lack of validating SystemBuffer.

### Reproduce
In the attached file DoS.zip, there are DoS.exe, DoS.cpp, WFHSetup_4.4.3.202.exe, and WiseFs64.sys. DoS.exe is the PoC to cause BSOD where WFHSetup_4.4.3.202.exe which contains the vulnerable driver WiseFs64.sys is installed, and DoS.cpp is the source code of DoS.exe. To reproduce the issue, install WFHSetup_4.4.3.202.exe and execute DoS.exe. It is expected that the system will crash (BSOD) once DoS.exe is executed. Password for attachment: DoS
