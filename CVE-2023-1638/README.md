### Version

* https://www.iobit.com/en/malware-fighter.php

### Impact
Denial of Service

### Description
From IoControlCode 0x8001E024 and 0x8001E040, a normal user can cause DoS due to the lack of validating SystemBuffer.

### Reproduce
In the attached file DoS1.zip, there are DoS1.exe, DoS1.cpp, iobit_malware_fighter_setup.exe, and ImfRegistryFilter.sys. DoS1.exe is the PoC to cause BSOD where iobit_malware_fighter_setup.exe which contains the vulnerable driver ImfRegistryFilter.sys is installed, and DoS1.cpp is the source code of DoS1.exe. To reproduce the issue, install iobit_malware_fighter_setup.exe and execute DoS1.exe. It is expected that the system will crash (BSOD) once DoS1.exe is executed. Password for attachment: DoS1
