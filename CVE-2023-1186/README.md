## Webcam for Remote Desktop, ftwebcam.sys, DoS

### Vulnerability Info
* CVE-2023-1186
* [VulDB](https://vuldb.com/?id.222358)
* [MITRE CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-1186)

### Version
* Webcam for Remote Desktop 2.8.42, ftwebcam.sys 2.8.11.0, DoS
* https://www.fabulatech.com/webcam-for-remote-desktop.html

### Impact
Denial of Service

### Description
From IoControlCode 0x222010 and 0x222018, a normal user can cause null pointer dereference due to the lack of validating the return value of ExAllocatePoolWithTag, which leads to DoS.

### Reproduce
In the attached file DoS1.zip, there are DoS1.exe, DoS1.cpp, webcam-for-remote-desktop-server-64bit.msi, and ftwebcam.sys. DoS1.exe is the PoC to cause BSOD where webcam-for-remote-desktop-server-64bit.msi contains the vulnerable driver ftwebcam.sys installed, and DoS1.cpp is the source code of DoS1.exe. To reproduce the issue, install webcam-for-remote-desktop-server-64bit.msi and execute DoS1.exe. It is expected that the system will crash (BSOD) once DoS1.exe is executed.
