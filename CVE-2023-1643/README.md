## IObit Malware Fighter, ImfHpRegFilter.sys, DoS

### Vulnerability Info
* CVE-2023-1643
* [VulDB](https://vuldb.com/?id.224023)
* [MITRE CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-1643)

### Version
* IObit Malware Fighter 9.4.0.776, ImfHpRegFilter.sys 8.0.0.0
* https://www.iobit.com/en/malware-fighter.php

### Impact
Denial of Service

### Description
From IoControlCode 0x8001E000, 0x8001E004, 0x8001E018, 0x8001E01C, 0x8001E024, and 0x8001E040, a normal user can cause DoS due to the lack of validating SystemBuffer.

### Reproduce
In the attached file DoS.zip, there are DoS.exe, DoS.cpp, iobit_malware_fighter_setup.exe, and ImfHpRegFilter.sys. DoS.exe is the PoC to cause BSOD where iobit_malware_fighter_setup.exe which contains the vulnerable driver ImfHpRegFilter.sys is installed, and DoS.cpp is the source code of DoS.exe. To reproduce the issue, install iobit_malware_fighter_setup.exe and execute DoS.exe. It is expected that the system will crash (BSOD) once DoS.exe is executed. Password for attachment: DoS
