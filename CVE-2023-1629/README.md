### Impact
Memory Corruption

### Description
From IoControlCode 0x222010, a normal user can write into any valid address which can be leveraged to abuse criticle kernel structures if the linked list is not null.

### Reproduce
In the attached file ArbitraryAddressWrite.zip, there are ArbitraryAddressWrite.exe, ArbitraryAddressWrite.cpp, JMV21Web20220419.exe, and kvcore.sys. ArbitraryAddressWrite.exe is the PoC to cause BSOD where JMV21Web20220419.exe contains the vulnerable driver kvcore.sys installed, and ArbitraryAddressWrite.cpp is the source code of ArbitraryAddressWrite.exe. To reproduce the issue, install JMV21Web20220419.exe and execute ArbitraryAddressWrite.exe. It is expected that the target address will be written once ArbitraryAddressWrite.exe is executed.
