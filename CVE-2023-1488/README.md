### Impact
Denial of Service

### Description
From IoControlCode 0x9C40A0D8, 0x9C40A0DC, and 0x9C40A0E0, a normal user can call __outbyte, __outword, and __outdword respectively, which can lead to denial of service and other unknown impacts toward system e.g. UEFI attack.

### Reproduce
In the attached file DoS2.zip, there are DoS2.exe, DoS2.cpp, WSMSetup_1.5.3.127.exe, and WiseHDInfo64.dll(which in fact a .sys). DoS2.exe is the PoC to cause DoS where WSMSetup_1.5.3.127.exe which contains the vulnerable driver WiseHDInfo64.dll is installed, and DoS2.cpp is the source code of DoS2.exe. To reproduce the issue, install WSMSetup_1.5.3.127.exe and execute DoS2.exe. It is expected that the system will restart once DoS2.exe is executed. Password for attachment: DoS2
